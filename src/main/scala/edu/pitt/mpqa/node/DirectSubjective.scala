/**
 * Represents a direct subjective annotation.
 *
 * A '''direct subjectivity''' (DS) is for a direct expression of private states, or
 * a subjective speech event. A DS object does not have targets directly as one of its field,
 * the targets are found in the `attitudes` field.
 *
 * See [[Attitude Attitude]] for a description of changes from MPQA 2 to 3.
 *
 * @param sentence The sentence that this DS belongs to.
 * @param span The text span of this DS annotation.
 * @param nestedSource The nested source of this DS.
 * @param attitudes A collection of attitude annotations in this DS.
 * @param expressionIntensity The intensity of the direct private state expression or
 *                            the speech event itself in this DS annotation.
 * @param intensity The overall intensity of the private state being expressed, considering this
 *                  DS and everything inside its scope.
 * @param insubstantiality (TODO: What exactly are the criteria for a DS to be insubstantial? )
